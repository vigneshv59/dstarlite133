# DstarLite -- CS 133b Final Project

This implementation of dstarlite is designed to run on various generated mazes. Look at `dstarlite.py` to see instructions on changing the
maze used. The robots visibility radius in simulation can also be changed in `grid.py`.

    Usage: dstarlite.py [maze_num]
    The maze_num maps as follows.
    Small maze: 0
    Large maze: 1
    No path: 2
